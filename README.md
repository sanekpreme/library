cd java-project-examples/spring-boot-library
```

To access all the functions of the application, you must have administrator access rights, to do this, simply go to the administration tab and grant the rights to the required user.

### Web Application Configuration

Go to the application properties file and make changes to it according to your settings.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql:your-path-to-db
spring.datasource.username=some-username
spring.datasource.password=some-password

upload.path=path-for-save-images

spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com (if you are using a different domain then change this setting)
spring.mail.username=some@gmail.com (mail from which messages will be sent to activate the user account)
spring.mail.password=some-password
```
